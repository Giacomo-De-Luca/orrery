"""
Build a small, shippable seed snapshot from the production data stores.

Exports a fixed set of demo collections from the (large) production
``main.duckdb`` + ``vector_db`` into a tiny ``resources/seed/`` directory that
is committed to git. On a fresh clone the backend copies this seed into place
on first startup (see ``backend.utils.seed_bootstrap``), so the dashboard
renders a populated default with no setup, network, or model download.

What gets exported (see SEED_COLLECTIONS):
  - emotion              (1000 rows, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, Gemini topic labels)
  - xkcd_hilbert_gemini  (954 rows, gemini-embedding, rainbow mapped_colour)

DuckDB side: the seed DB is created with the canonical schema (via
``DuckDBClient``), then production rows for the target datasets/collections are
copied in FK-dependency order via ``ATTACH ... (READ_ONLY)`` + ``INSERT SELECT``.

ChromaDB side: vectors are read from each source collection and re-added to a
fresh ``PersistentClient`` (rebuilds a clean HNSW index with the installed
Chroma version → version-robust). The source collection ``metadata`` is
preserved verbatim so live semantic search can reconstruct the embedding
function (see ``ChromaDBClient.get_collection``).

IMPORTANT: run with the backend STOPPED — DuckDB is single-writer and the
production DB is locked while the server is running.

Usage:
    uv run python -m interpretability_backend.scripts.build_seed_snapshot
