"""First-run seed bootstrap.

On a fresh clone the live data stores (``resources/main.duckdb`` +
``resources/vector_db/``) do not exist — they are gitignored. This module
copies the committed seed snapshot (``resources/seed/``, built by
``scripts.build_seed_snapshot``) into place so the dashboard renders a
populated default on first launch.

The copy only happens when the live DuckDB is **absent**. It never overwrites
an existing database, so a developer's real (large) data store is always safe.
