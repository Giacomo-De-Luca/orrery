"""Canonical residual-stream capture sites, decoupled from any one backend.

The refusal / poetry direction pipelines extract candidate directions at a
handful of points inside each decoder layer. Historically those points were
named with Gemma's internal-cache strings (``pre_attn`` / ``post_attn`` /
``mlp_out`` / ``post_mlp``). ``CaptureSite`` keeps those strings as the
canonical identifiers — so config fields, ``mean_diffs_<site>.pt`` artifact
names, and JSON/CSV columns are unchanged — while giving each a semantic name
and a per-backend resolution.

Gemma resolves a site directly to its fork-cache intermediate name
(``CaptureSite.value``). Qwen has no ``pre_attn`` capture point and a
different naming, so each site maps to a ``(HookType, layer_offset)`` pair:

    RESID_PRE[L]  == RESID_POST[L-1]   (block input == previous block output)
    POST_ATTN[L]  == POST_ATTN[L]
    MLP_OUT[L]    == MLP_OUT[L]
    RESID_POST[L] == RESID_POST[L]

``RESID_PRE`` at layer 0 (the embedding output, before any attention) has no
``RESID_POST[-1]`` source; the adapter leaves it as zeros. This matches
Gemma, where ``pre_attn`` at layer 0 over the constant end-of-instruction
positions is identically zero (the suffix tokens are the same across prompts,
so their pre-attention mean-diff vanishes) and is discarded by the zero-norm
filter downstream.
